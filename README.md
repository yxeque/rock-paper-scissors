# [JS Rock Paper Scissors](https://yxeque.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)
TOP Foundations Course Rock Paper Scissors Project

I did the console only part mostly on my own (yay me), but got lost when implementing the GUI.

Shoutout BroCode and his video right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uKdQx-SZ5A&t=1s), it made things more clear for me. His tutorial served as the foundation of this project, and I basically just refactored most of his code (the tutorial still uses `getElementById`), and used more functions and separate event listeners. This project made me more used to functions as a whole.

Key Features:
- Cool Rock-Paper-Scissors buttons
- Dynamic displays for player and computer choices, scores, and game results
